# Machine Learning Pulsar Classifier

In this project various classifier models have been developed. The main purpose is to analyze the effectiveness of these models on a binary task. 
[HTRU2 Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/HTRU2) have been employed.

Since this is an academic project classifier models have been developed from scratch **without help of external libraries/frameworks for Machine Learning**.
